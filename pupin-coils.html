<h1>Pupin coils</h1>

<img src="pupin-1916.jpg" alt="A picture of Pupin">

<p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called <strong>"Pupin coils"</strong>, followed closely on the pioneering<br>  work of the English physicist and mathematician
 Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some <br> seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired 
 by <br> <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T)</em>, making him wealthy. Although AT&amp;T bought Pupin's patent, <br>they made little use of it, as they already had their own 
 development in hand led by George Campbell and <br>had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&amp;T were afraid they would lose <br> control 
 of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long <br>distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
